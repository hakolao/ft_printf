# Dragon4 implementation of double to array (dtoa)
The dragon4 algorithm follows cpp guide / code by [ryanjuckett](http://www.ryanjuckett.com/programming/printing-floating-point-numbers/).

The algorithm is the same, but code has been changed to match my printf implementation and to follow School 42 norms.
